# Detector training based on Faster RCNN for pytorch

Based on [https://github.com/chenyuntc/simple-faster-rcnn-pytorch](https://github.com/chenyuntc/simple-faster-rcnn-pytorch).



# Installation

We need a few libraries set up. You can either use docker or anaconda.


## Variant A: Docker instructions

Build docker image

        cd docker/ && sudo docker build -t rcnn -f Dockerfile .

Run docker image

        nvidia-docker run -it -v /datadrive:/datadrive -v $(pwd):/code --net="host" -p 8097:8097 --ipc=host rcnn bash

## If you get a build error…
	
I had an image that didn't work for me on Ubuntu 16, so I followed the steps here:
	
    https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce
			
…to update docker.
	
	
# Run the image with an interactive shell, mounting your data and code directories
	
This assumes you've put the data in /sealdata, and that you're currently in the repo directory.
	
    sudo nvidia-docker run -it -v /sealdata:/datadrive -v $(pwd):/code --ipc=host -p 8097:8097 rcnn

## Variant B: Anaconda instructions

You can install all requirements using

        conda install numpy pyyaml scipy ipython mkl mkl-include tqdm cupy scikit-image matplotlib
        conda install -y -c conda-forge visdom fire
        conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
        pip install --no-cache-dir git+https://github.com/pytorch/tnt.git@master

You can refer to the instructions of the docker file `docker/Dockerfile` for more details.


# Download the base (vgg16) model file

You want to run the following in the "FasterRCNNDetection" directory.

    python misc/convert_caffe_pretrain.py && mv vgg16_caffe.pth data/


# Build some native components

Improves performance, not strictly necessary.  Run from the "FasterRCNNDetection" directory.

    conda install cython && cd model/utils/nms/ && python3 build.py build_ext --inplace

# Running the training

Afterwards, you can start the actual training. All available options are shown in `utils/config.py`. To start the detector training, you can use

        python train.py train \
        --env='fasterrcnn-caffe' \
        --plot-every=100 \
        --caffe-pretrain  \
        --train_annotation='train_bboxes.json' \
        --val_annotation='/data/val_bboxes.json' \
        --image_root='/data/' \
        --dataset='oneclass'

You move this command to a bash script. We provide a sample script `run_training.sh`, which can be used by executing:

    chmod a+x ./run_training.sh
    ./run_training.sh

# README of simpler-faster-rcnn: A Simple and Fast Implementation of Faster R-CNN

## 1. Introduction

This project is a **Simplified** Faster R-CNN implementation based on [chainercv](https://github.com/chainer/chainercv) and other [projects](#acknowledgement) . It aims to:

- Simplify the code (*Simple is better than complex*)
- Make the code more straightforward (*Flat is better than nested*)
- Match the performance reported in [origin paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497) (*Speed Counts and mAP Matters*)

And it has the following features:
- It can be run as pure Python code, no more build affair. (cuda code moves to cupy, Cython acceleration are optional)
- It's a minimal implemention in around 2000 lines valid code with a lot of comment and instruction.(thanks to chainercv's excellent documentation)
- It achieves higher mAP than the origin implementation (0.712 VS 0.699)
- It achieve speed compariable with other implementation (6fps and 14fps for train and test in TITAN XP with cython)
- It's memory-efficient (about 3GB for vgg16)

## 2. Performance

### 2.1 mAP

VGG16 train on `trainval` and test on `test` split. 

**Note**: the training shows great randomness, you may need a bit of luck and more epoches of training to reach the highest mAP. However, it should be easy to surpass the lower bound. 

|              Implementation              |     mAP     |
| :--------------------------------------: | :---------: |
| [origin paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497) |    0.699    |
|    train with caffe pretrained model     | 0.700-0.712 |
| train with torchvision pretrained model  | 0.685-0.701 |
| model converted from [chainercv](https://github.com/chainer/chainercv/tree/master/examples/faster_rcnn) (reported 0.706) |   0.7053    |

### 2.2 Speed

|              Implementation              |   GPU    | Inference | Trainining |
| :--------------------------------------: | :------: | :-------: | :--------: |
| [origin paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497) |   K40    |   5 fps   |     NA     |
|                 This[1]                  | TITAN Xp | 14-15 fps |   6 fps    |
| [pytorch-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/ruotianluo/pytorch-faster-rcnn) | TITAN Xp | 15-17fps  |    6fps    |

[1]: make sure you install cupy correctly and only one program run on the GPU. The training speed is sensitive to your gpu status. see [troubleshooting](troubleshooting) for more info. Morever it's slow in the start of the program. 

It could be faster by removing visualization, logging, averaging loss etc.
## 3. Install dependencies

requires python3 and PyTorch 0.3

- install PyTorch >=0.3 with GPU (code are GPU-only), refer to [official website](http://pytorch.org)

- install cupy, you can install via `pip install` but it's better to read the [docs](https://docs-cupy.chainer.org/en/latest/install.html#install-cupy-with-cudnn-and-nccl) and make sure the environ is correctly set

- install other dependencies:  `pip install -r requirements.txt `

- Optional, but strongly recommended: build cython code `nms_gpu_post`: 

  ```Bash
  cd model/utils/nms/
  python3 build.py build_ext --inplace
  ```

- start vidom for visualization

```Bash
nohup python3 -m visdom.server &
```


## 4. Demo

Download pretrained model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cQ27LIn-Rig4-Uayzy_gH5-cW-NRGVzY) or [Baidu Netdisk( passwd: scxn)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1o87RuXW)


See [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/chenyuntc/simple-faster-rcnn-pytorch/blob/master/demo.ipynb) for more detail.

## 5. Train

### 5.1 Prepare data

#### Pascal VOC2007

1. Download the training, validation, test data and VOCdevkit

   ```Bash
   wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar
   wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar
   wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCdevkit_08-Jun-2007.tar
   ```

2. Extract all of these tars into one directory named `VOCdevkit`

   ```Bash
   tar xvf VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar
   tar xvf VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar
   tar xvf VOCdevkit_08-Jun-2007.tar
   ```

3. It should have this basic structure

   ```Bash
   $VOCdevkit/                           # development kit
   $VOCdevkit/VOCcode/                   # VOC utility code
   $VOCdevkit/VOC2007                    # image sets, annotations, etc.
   # ... and several other directories ...
   ```

4. modify `voc_data_dir` cfg item in `utils/config.py`, or pass it to program using argument like `--voc-data-dir=/path/to/VOCdevkit/VOC2007/` .

#### COCO

TBD

### 5.2 Prepare caffe-pretrained vgg16

If you want to use caffe-pretrain model as initial weight, you can run below to get vgg16 weights converted from caffe, which is the same as the origin paper use.

````Bash
python misc/convert_caffe_pretrain.py
````

This scripts would download pretrained model and converted it to the format compatible with torchvision. 

Then you should specify where caffe-pretraind model `vgg16_caffe.pth` stored in `utils/config.py` by setting `caffe_pretrain_path`

If you want to use pretrained model from torchvision, you may skip this step.

**NOTE**, caffe pretrained model has shown slight better performance.

**NOTE**: caffe model require images in BGR 0-255, while torchvision model requires images in RGB and 0-1. See `data/dataset.py`for more detail. 

### 5.3 begin training

```Bash
mkdir checkpoints/ # folder for snapshots
```

```bash
python3 train.py train --env='fasterrcnn-caffe' --plot-every=100 --caffe-pretrain    
```

you may refer to `utils/config.py` for more argument.

Some Key arguments:

- `--caffe-pretrain=False`: use pretrain model from caffe or torchvision (Default: torchvison)
- `--plot-every=n`: visualize prediction, loss etc every `n` batches.
- `--env`: visdom env for visualization
- `--voc_data_dir`: where the VOC data stored
- `--use-drop`: use dropout in RoI head, default False
- `--use-Adam`: use Adam instead of SGD, default SGD. (You need set a very low `lr` for Adam)
- `--load-path`: pretrained model path, default `None`, if it's specified, it would be loaded.

you may open browser, visit `http://<ip>:8097` and see the visualization of training procedure as below:

![visdom](http://7zh43r.com2.z0.glb.clouddn.com/del/visdom-fasterrcnn.png) 

If you're in China and encounter problem with visdom (i.e. timeout, blank screen), you may refer to [visdom issue](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom/issues/111#issuecomment-321743890), and see [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for solution.

## Troubleshooting
- visdom

  Some js files in visdom was blocked in China, see simple solution [here](https://github.com/chenyuntc/PyTorch-book/blob/master/README.md#visdom打不开及其解决方案)

  Also, `updata=append` doesn't work due to a bug brought in latest version, see [issue](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom/issues/233) and [fix](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom/pull/234/files)

  You don't need to build from source, modifying related files would be OK.

- dataloader: `received 0 items of ancdata` 

  see [discussion](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/973#issuecomment-346405667), It's alreadly fixed in [train.py](https://github.com/chenyuntc/simple-faster-rcnn-pytorch/blob/master/train.py#L17-L22). So I think you are free from this problem.
  
- cupy `numpy.core._internal.AxisError: axis 1 out of bounds [0, 1)`

  bug of cupy, see [issue](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/issues/793), fix via [pull request](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/pull/749)

  You don't need to build from source, modifying related files would be OK.

- VGG: Slow in construction

  VGG16 is slow in construction(i.e. 9 seconds),it could be speed up by this [PR](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/pull/377)
  
  You don't need to build from source, modifying related files would be OK.

- About the speed

  One strange thing is that, even the code doesn't use chainer, but if I remove `from chainer import cuda`, the speed drops a lot (train 6.5->6.1,test 14.5->10), because Chainer replaces the default allocator of CuPy by its memory pool implementation. But ever since V4.0, cupy use memory pool as default. However you need to build from souce if you are gona use the latest version of cupy (uninstall cupy -> git clone -> git checkout v4.0 -> setup.py install) @_@

  Another simple fix: add `from chainer import cuda` at the begining of `train.py`. in such case,you'll need to `pip install chainer` first.
