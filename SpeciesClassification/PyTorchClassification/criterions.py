    r"""The `Kullback-Leibler divergence`_ Loss as provided by torch.nn with
    the only difference being that the loss now applies log_softmax before
    computing the KL divergence.

    The original doc:
    KL divergence is a useful distance measure for continuous distributions
    and is often useful when performing direct regression over the space of
    (discretely sampled) continuous output distributions.

    As with `NLLLoss`, the `input` given is expected to contain
    *log-probabilities*, however unlike `ClassNLLLoss`, `input` is not
    restricted to a 2D Tensor, because the criterion is applied element-wise.

    This criterion expects a `target` `Tensor` of the same size as the
    `input` `Tensor`.

    The loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
        l_n = y_n \odot \left( \log y_n - x_n \right),

    where :math:`N` is the batch size. If reduce is ``True``, then:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
            \operatorname{mean}(L), & \text{if}\; \text{size_average} = \text{True},\\
            \operatorname{sum}(L),  & \text{if}\; \text{size_average} = \text{False}.
        \end{cases}

    By default, the losses are averaged for each minibatch over observations
    **as well as** over dimensions. However, if the field
    `size_average` is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed.

    Args:
        size_average (bool, optional: By default, the losses are averaged
            for each minibatch over observations **as well as** over
            dimensions. However, if ``False`` the losses are instead summed.
        reduce (bool, optional): By default, the losses are averaged
            over observations for each minibatch, or summed, depending on
            size_average. When reduce is ``False``, returns a loss per input/target
            element instead and ignores size_average. Default: ``True``

          dimensions
        - target: :math:`(N, *)`, same shape as the input
        - output: scalar. If `reduce` is ``True``, then :math:`(N, *)`,
            same shape as the input

class BCEWithLogitsLoss2(torch.nn.modules.loss._Loss):
    r"""
    Binary cross-entropy as provided by torch.nn, with the only difference being a
    different aggregation strategy, which matches the aggregation used in the normal cross
    entropy loss.

    Original doc:
    This loss combines a `Sigmoid` layer and the `BCELoss` in one single
    class. This version is more numerically stable than using a plain `Sigmoid`
    followed by a `BCELoss` as, by combining the operations into one layer,
    we take advantage of the log-sum-exp trick for numerical stability.

    The loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
        l_n = - w_n \left[ t_n \cdot \log \sigma(x_n)
        + (1 - t_n) \cdot \log (1 - \sigma(x_n)) \right],

    where :math:`N` is the batch size. If reduce is ``True``, then

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
            \operatorname{mean}(L), & \text{if}\; \text{size_average} = \text{True},\\
            \operatorname{sum}(L),  & \text{if}\; \text{size_average} = \text{False}.
        \end{cases}

    This is used for measuring the error of a reconstruction in for example
    an auto-encoder. Note that the targets `t[i]` should be numbers
    between 0 and 1.

    It's possible to trade off recall and precision by adding weights to positive examples.
    In this case the loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
        l_n = - w_n \left[ p_n t_n \cdot \log \sigma(x_n)
        + (1 - t_n) \cdot \log (1 - \sigma(x_n)) \right],

    where :math:`p_n` is the positive weight of class :math:`n`.
    :math:`p_n > 1` increases the recall, :math:`p_n < 1` increases the precision.

    For example, if a dataset contains 100 positive and 300 negative examples of a single class,
    then `pos_weight` for the class should be equal to :math:`\frac{300}{100}=3`.
    The loss would act as if the dataset contains math:`3\times 100=300` positive examples.

    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to the loss
            of each batch element. If given, has to be a Tensor of size
            "nbatch".
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when reduce is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            'none' | 'elementwise_mean' | 'sum'. 'none': no reduction will be applied,
            'elementwise_mean': the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, 'sum': the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: 'elementwise_mean'
        pos_weight (Tensor, optional): a weight of positive examples.
                Must be a vector with length equal to the number of classes.

     Shape:
         - Input: :math:`(N, *)` where `*` means, any number of additional
           dimensions
         - Target: :math:`(N, *)`, same shape as the input
